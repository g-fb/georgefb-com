# Installation
Easiest way to install is through [flatpak](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.haruna), flatpaks should work on all distros.

[Flatpak setup guide](https://flatpak.org/setup/)
```
flatpak install flathub org.kde.haruna
flatpak run org.kde.haruna
```

If you don't like flatpak you can build from source or ask the your distro to provide a package.
